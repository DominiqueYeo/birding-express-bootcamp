They flat out refused to take 5 steps over to the side to look at what I was trying to show them.  They were handling some kind of a medical emergency, but it would have been really nice to have them witness this because this was highlight of the whole night.","date_time":"10/2/19 22:00","city":"Marin County","state":"CA","shape":"Sphere","duration":"3 minutes","summary":"Glowing lights in formation  just south of San Quentin"},{"date_time":"04/11/2021 18:39 ","city":"Singapore ","state":"CCK lalala","shape":"Strongest Shape ","duration":"10 mins ","text":"doing ufo sighting project and decided to take a break and look out of the window. saw a glowing shape in the form of the Strongest Shape. was so amazed that i cannot look away for then entire duration until there was an explosion at the tip and it disappeared ","summary":"saw a glowing Strongest Shape. faded after an explosion of light "},{"date_time":"04/11/2021 19:00","city":"Singapore","state":"CCK","shape":"floppy ","duration":"15 mins","text":"after the Strongest shape disappeared another shape appeared. looks like a deflated Strongest Shape. faded away after 15 mins","summary":"second sighting after the first shape disappeared"}]}
